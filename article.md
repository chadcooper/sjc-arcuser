The power of GIS lies in it's ability to be used by anyone for 
virtually anything - its ability to truly _empower_ users at all 
levels. The ArcGIS Platform excels in this arena, providing the 
software, tools, and templates to allow organizations to 
produce applications to empower their end users. One such 
organization is the St. Johns County, Florida Water 
Utility, a provider of water, sanitary sewer and reuse water 
services to 42,000 accounts and 100,000 residents in coastal 
northeast Florida Tibbitts, 2016). The Utilities' service area is experiencing 
new development and high growth, and as a result, in 2013 the St. Johns 
County Utility Department (SJCUD) initiated the 
development of an Integrated Water Resources Plan (IWRP) to 
implement water resources solutions through 2040. The IWRP 
indicates that by 2040, the SJCUD customer base will grow by 
88,000 people under medium-growth scenarios (St. Johns County 
Utility Department, 2015). Current growth combined with this 
anticipated future growth is and will continue to bring challenges 
of expanded capacity, replacing infrastructure, and meeting new 
regulations for water reuse and availablity requirements 
(Tibbitts, 2016). For years the Utility has embraced the capabilities of 
its GIS, but in order to meet the needs of such high growth 
and expansion, they realized a variety of solutions would needed 
to be put in place to empower both their workforce and 
customers. These solutions begin at the data level and expand 
out to web and mobile applications for data entry, service outages, 
water quality, service availability, and capital funds expenditures.
