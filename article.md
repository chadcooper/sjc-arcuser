The power of GIS lies in it's ability to be used by anyone for 
virtually anything - its ability to truly _empower_ users at all 
levels. The ArcGIS Platform excels in this arena, providing the 
software, tools, and templates to allow organizations to 
produce applications to empower their end users.

One such organization is the St. Johns County, Florida Water 
Utility, a provider of water, sanitary sewer and reuse water 
services to 42,000 accounts and 100,000 residents in coastal 
northeast Florida.
